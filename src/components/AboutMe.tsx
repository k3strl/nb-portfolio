      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>I'm Nic, a full stack developer based in Minneapolis, MN. ❄️</p>
      <p>
        I've been using computers since before I have memories: from using them
        to create art, to building rudimentary static websites with HTML and
        CSS, to building a second brain with PKM (personal knowledge management)
        strategies and note-taking apps. But I always felt that programming was
        out of my reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best decision I ever made was to sign up for full-stack
        certification through the University of Minnesota. There I was
        encouraged to leave the comfort of my tutorial-hell, to dive in and get
        my hands dirty. I learned so much so quickly, and good friends and
        excellent teammates with those in my cohort. I'm eager to use that
        momentum and jump head-first into my new career, while continuing to
        learn, grow and improve along the way.
