        I'm Nic, a full stack developer based in Minneapolis, MN. ❄️
      </p>

        I've been obsessed with computers since I was in high school: from
        using them to create art, to building rudimentary static websites with
        HTML and CSS, to building a second brain with PKM (personal knowledge
        management) strategies and note-taking apps. But I always felt that I
        wasn't smart enough, or that I didn't begin learning soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        {/* Is this too personal? idfk */}
        The best decision I ever made was to sign up for full-stack
        certification through the University of Minnesota. There I was
        encouraged to leave the comfort of my tutorial-hell, to dive in and get
        my hands dirty. I learned so much so quickly, and made good friends with
        those in my cohort. I'm eager to jump head-first into my new career,
        while continuing to learn, grow and improve along the way.
