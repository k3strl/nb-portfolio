                <p>Welcome! I'm Nic, a full stack developer based in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
                <p>I've benen obsessed with computers since I was in high school: from using them to create art, to building rudimentary static websites with HTML and CSS, to building a second brain with PKM (personal knowledge management) strategies and note-taking apps. But I always felt that I wasn't smart enough, or that I didn't begin learning soon enough.</p>
                <p>The best decision I ever made was to sign up for full-stack certification through the University of Minnesota. There I was encouraged to leave the comfort of my tutorial-hell, to dive in and get my hands dirty. I learned so much so quickly, and made good friends with those in my cohort. I'm eager to jump head-first into my new career, while continuing to learn, grow and improve along the way.</p>
